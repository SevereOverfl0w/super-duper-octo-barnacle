= super-duper-octo-barnacle

A dumb wrapper around a random library I found on clojars.

== Usage (as an example)

. link:https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/wiki/Pushing#maven[Setup settings.xml]
. Change `pom.xml` and update the `groupId` to yours on Clojars
. `./deploy.sh` will make the jar and update the pom.xml, then upload to clojars

== Usage (as a library)

This library actually does something!
It outputs your percentile on Github.

I think 90 is bad.
Please leave me more stars.
